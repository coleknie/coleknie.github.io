I am a third-year Undergraduate Computer Science and International Affairs student at the George Washington University. My interests include issues of national security and cybersecurity issues. Currently, I work as a research assistant at the GW Usable Security and Privacy lab. I plan to pursue a M.S. in Cybersecurity shortly after my graduation. In my undergraduate studies, I concentrate in cybersecurity and security policy across my majors.

My previous work in Congress and at several NGOs has given me valuable experience in gaining a comprehensive and practical understanding of the policymaking process as well as diplomacy and international security issues. Moreover, my cybersecurity education and research has provided me with the skills to understand practical applications of computer science at various levels of abstraction. Through my cybersecurity and computer science course load, I have acquired knowledge about theory, algorithms, software engineering, database systems, computer architecture, usable security, and cryptography. 

I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and vulnerabilities that result from system design. My current research focuses on digital security literacy and education in Thailand. As a student of international relations, I am particularly interested in security issues that affect East and Southeast Asia as well as the Indo-Pacific. I have written about security threats affecting the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan as well as ASEAN.

My research interests include the impact of the increasingly perilous security environment on cybersecurity practices, in both system design and human-computer interaction. I am always looking for research and collaboration opportunities.
