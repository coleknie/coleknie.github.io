I am a third-year Undergraduate Computer Science and International Affairs student at the George Washington University. My interests include issues of national security and cybersecurity issues. Currently, I currently work as an intern for the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In the Fall 2023 semester, I will work as a research assistant at the GW Usable Security and Privacy lab. I plan to pursue an M.S. in Cybersecurity shortly after my graduation. My undergraduate studies concentrate on cybersecurity and security policy across my majors.

My previous work in Congress and at several NGOs has given me valuable experience in gaining a comprehensive and practical understanding of the policymaking process as well as diplomacy and international security issues. Moreover, my cybersecurity education and research have provided me with the skills to understand practical applications of computer science at various levels of abstraction. Through my cybersecurity and computer science course load, I have acquired knowledge about theory, algorithms, software engineering, database systems, computer architecture, usable security, and cryptography. 

I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and vulnerabilities that result from system design. As a student of international relations, I am particularly interested in security issues that affect East and Southeast Asia as well as the Indo-Pacific. I have written about security threats affecting the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan, as well as ASEAN. I have also written about cybersecurity threats to the healthcare sector.

My research interests include the impact of the increasingly perilous security environment on cybersecurity practices, in both system design and human-computer interaction. I am always looking for research and collaboration opportunities.  Please do not hesitate to contact me to request academic writing samples. I have recently written papers on South Korea's deterrence policy and Japan's role in creating a peaceful and free Indo-Pacfic. I have also written about cybersecurity issues in Israel, the UAE, Japan, and the Freely Associated States (FAS).
